- As mentioned in the preface, one of the challenges of understanding neural networks is that it requiresmultiple mental models. We’ll get a sense of that in this chapter: each of these three perspectivesexcludes certain essential features of the concepts we’ll cover, and only when taken together do theyprovide a full picture of both how and why nested mathematical functions work the way they do. In fact, Itake the uniquely strong view that any attempt to explain the building blocks of neural networks thatexcludes one of these three perspectives is incomplete.
